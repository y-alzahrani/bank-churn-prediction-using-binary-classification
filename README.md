# Binary Classification for Bank Churn Prediction

In this project, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machines algorithms were implemented to predict which bank customers will churn based on their data. The dataset used contains data about 11 features for 10,000 customers. One of these features is the churn label which takes two possible values; 1 if the customer churned, and 0 otherwise. This is the target feature that we aim to predict.

The aims of this project are to develop binary classification models that predict customer churn and to determine which customer features have the greatest effect on the likelihood of churn.

Please refer to the [report](report.pdf) for the analysis and discussion of the results.

Note: Scikit-learn library was deliberately not used in executing the logistic regression and KNN algorithms.
